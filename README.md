# Profitable App Profiles for App Store & Google Play Markets

This project focuses on identifying profitable mobile app profiles for both App Store and Google Play markets. (In this hypothetical scenario) As part of the data analytics team at a mobile app development company, the primary objective is to support data-driven decision-making for the types of apps to build.

The fictional company specialises in developing free-to-download apps, with revenue generated primarily through in-app advertisements. Consequently, the success of any app is closely tied to its user base. Through data analysis, this Jupyter python project aims to uncover insights about app categories and features that are most likely to attract a large number of users, helping guide the development team toward creating apps with high user engagement potential.
